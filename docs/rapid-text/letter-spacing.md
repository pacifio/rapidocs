# Letter spacing

Apply letter spacing to text with rapid

## How to apply letter spacing

To apply text letter spacing you need to use the following pattern `tracking-[range]`

Here is an example

```dart
RapidText(
  text: "Demo",
  styles: "tracking-tight",
);

RapidText(
  text: "Demo",
  styles: "tracking-wide",
);
```

## Accepted letter spacing

* `tracking-tighter`
* `tracking-tight`
* `tracking-normal`
* `tracking-wide`
* `tracking-wider`
* `tracking-widest`
