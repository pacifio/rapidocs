# Text alignment

Apply text alignments with rapid

## How to apply a text alignment

To apply text alignment you need to use the following pattern `text-[alignment]`

Here is an example

```dart
RapidText(
  text: "Demo",
  styles: "text-left",
);

RapidText(
  text: "Demo",
  styles: "text-justify",
);
```

## Accepted text alignments

* `text-left`
* `text-right`
* `text-center`
* `text-start`
* `text-end`
* `text-justify`
